# E-commerce User Behavior Dashboard (Power BI)

This pet project explores user behavior data from an e-commerce platform using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes key metrics like user actions, brand performance, and revenue distribution to understand interaction patterns and business impact.

# Project Goal

Analyze how users interact with products (views, carts, purchases) and identify trends in brand performance and user intent.


# Dashboards Included

| **Event Type Distribution** | Bar chart showing number of views, carts, and purchases
| **Top Brands by Events** | Brand popularity based on user interactions 
| **Total Sales Value by Brand** | Line chart showing revenue per brand 
| **Revenue by Event Type (Pie)** | Pie chart visualizing revenue share by action type 

# Key Insights

- Over 96% of user activity is passive (views)
- Apple leads in total revenue despite fewer interactions
- Samsung and Xiaomi dominate in user interest
- Revenue is concentrated in few high-value purchases

# Tools Used

- Power BI: visuals, filters, formatting, layout
  DAX: calculated columns for time and aggregation
- GitHub: documentation and versioning
- 
# Files Included

- `ecommerce_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI project file  
- `README.md` – this file  

# Next Steps

- Add funnel analysis (view → cart → purchase)
- Include conversion rates
- Expand to multiple days for time-series trends
- Add slicers for interactivity by brand/category
